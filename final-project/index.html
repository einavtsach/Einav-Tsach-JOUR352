                        There’s a looming problem with the auto industry’s grand
                        EV plans.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Automakers are spending huge sums to bring a slew of new
                        electric vehicles to market over the next few years.
                        Ford Motor alone expects to spend more than $50 billion
                        through 2026 to ramp up EV production around the world.
                        General Motors said it will spend $35 billion through
                        2025, and Volkswagen said it expects to spend almost
                        $200 billion on EVs and related software through 2028.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But Americans are still hesitant to buy in, and largely
                        because of concerns around charging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Survey after survey has shown that worries about
                        charging — specifically, public charging — is holding
                        buyers back from electric vehicles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A June study by Cox Automotive found that 32% of
                        consumers who were considering an EV cited a “lack of
                        charging stations in my area” as a barrier to purchase.
                        A Consumer Reports study in April found that “charging
                        logistics” and “purchase price” were the two biggest
                        factors holding consumers back. And an April poll by the
                        Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and
                        the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs
                        Research found that 47% of U.S. adults said it’s not
                        likely they would buy an EV as their next car, with
                        nearly 80% saying that a lack of charging stations was a
                        factor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the United Auto Workers’ concerns about
                        Detroit’s transition to EVs, and the union’s ongoing
                        strike, there’s a groundswell forming to expand and
                        improve the U.S. charging landscape. President Joe Biden
                        has pushed the issue, working with Congress to deliver
                        major incentives to improve public charging, and rival
                        automakers have struck rare partnerships to help
                        establish a single charging standard and reduce pain
                        points for EV drivers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the question remains, how long — and how severely —
                        will charging hamper the EV revolution, right as its
                        finally picking up steam?
                    </p>
                    <h2>How and where do I charge my EV?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Public charging stations aren’t quite like gas stations,
                        in the sense that many EV owners only use them
                        occasionally. Most EV owners do most of their charging
                        at home, with a Level 2 home charger provided by the
                        automaker or a third party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That won’t work for everyone, of course. And even EV
                        owners who charge at home use public chargers on
                        occasion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some EV motorists charge at work. Workplaces that have
                        employee parking often have chargers available, as do a
                        growing number of hotels, shopping centers and other
                        places where people might park an EV for a few hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often called “destination chargers,” these charge at
                        rates similar to what you’d get with home chargers,
                        adding around 35 miles of range per hour. You may need
                        an app from a charging company to use them, but the
                        process is mostly painless — assuming the chargers are
                        working.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Destination chargers can be a great way to add some
                        range if you’re planning to be parked for a while. But
                        on a road trip, you’ll want a fast charger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Modern fast chargers deliver much more power to your
                        car’s battery than the chargers that most EV drivers use
                        at home or work, enough to charge your car to 80% in
                        roughly half an hour, more or less.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the cost of fast-charging varies with time of day
                        and location, it’s usually cheaper than a tank of gas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And though Tesla drivers have it relatively easy,
                        finding a charger that works with other EVs away from
                        home — and specifically, finding one that is working —
                        can be a frustrating experience.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why do Teslas have it so much easier?</h2>
                    <p>
                        According to the U.S. Department of Energy, almost
                        21,000 of the roughly 33,000 public fast chargers
                        currently up and running in the U.S. are Tesla
                        Superchargers. Those chargers, like Tesla’s own
                        destination chargers, use a unique plug design called
                        NACS, short for North American Charging Standard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tesla originally built its Supercharging network to
                        overcome potential buyers’ concerns about charging on
                        road trips, back when there were few fast chargers
                        available in the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The network’s extent and reliability became a key part
                        of Tesla’s early sales pitch to customers hesitant to
                        take the leap to a fully electric EV, and it has
                        continued to play an important role in its success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The charging option for most everyone else — called the
                        Combined Charging System, or CCS — is harder to come by
                        and often unreliable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The shortcomings of CCS have been a growing concern for
                        global automakers — and the Detroit companies in
                        particular — as they spend billions on new EVs. Simply
                        put, America’s patchwork of CCS chargers offers spotty
                        coverage, hard-to-use devices, and, too often, chargers
                        that are broken.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CCS charging operators like ChargePoint and EVgo have
                        recently begun taking major steps to improve the “up
                        time” of their chargers, or the percentage of time the
                        charger is available for use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the reliability issue remains a big one. In a study
                        last year, researchers at the University of California
                        at Berkeley checked 675 CCS fast chargers in the Bay
                        Area and found that almost a quarter of them weren’t
                        functional. More recently, an August 2023 study by JD
                        Power found that customer satisfaction with public CCS
                        chargers — both destination chargers and fast chargers —
                        has fallen sharply over the last few years, with
                        reliability ranking as a key issue.

                        Notably, that JD Power study also found customer
                        satisfaction with Tesla’s proprietary fast-charging
                        network to be much higher than the CCS alternatives.

                    </p>
                    <h2>What about a single charging standard?</h2>
                    <p>Tesla has begun bringing its rivals into the fold.</p>
                    <p>
                        The EV leader and Ford surprised the automotive world in
                        May when they announced they had struck a deal to give
                        Ford EV owners access to more than 12,000 Tesla
                        superchargers in the U.S. and Canada starting in early
                        2024.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ford also said that it will make the NACS charging port
                        standard on its EVs starting in 2025. (Owners of older
                        Ford EVs will be able to use the Tesla chargers with an
                        adapter.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It might seem strange for one of the world’s oldest
                        automakers to partner with the EV maker Tesla instead of
                        building its own charging network. But as Ford finance
                        chief John Lawler explained at a June conference that
                        the tie-up makes sense for Ford and its customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We’re going to build things where we think we can be
                        differentiated,” Lawler said. “We’re going to partner
                        where it’s really good for our customers and where we
                        can scale quickly. Opening up the Tesla charging network
                        to our customers, that’s about them and it scales very
                        quickly for them. Their options are much greater.”

                        A flurry of similar deals between Tesla and other EV

                        other [automakers] have signed up to use our connector
                        and gain access to our charging network,” Tesla CEO Elon
                        Musk said during the company’s most recent earnings
                        call. “We strongly believe in helping other car
                        companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just
                        trying to do the right thing in general.”

                    <p>
                        The broad uptake of Tesla’s charging tech is generally
                        good news.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The company’s network consistently scores well for
                        reliability. Its NACS plugs are also considerably
                        smaller and lighter than CCS fast-charging plugs, which
                        can be cumbersome for older or disabled drivers to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What’s more, Tesla’s chargers all work the same way,
                        whereas CCS chargers from rival companies may have very
                        different procedures. And, unlike most CCS fast
                        chargers, Tesla’s billing is simple and seamless: Owners
                        simply plug in, charge up and drive away, with no
                        special apps or credit cards required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While it’s not yet clear how the process will work for
                        drivers of other EVs, it’s expected to be similarly
                        painless once the driver (or the car) is signed up with
                        Tesla.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, progress is being made on formalizing the
                        NACS plug design as an industry standard. SAE
                        International, which sets key engineering standards for
                        the auto industry, said on June 27 that it’s working on
                        official performance and safety standards for NACS
                        charging plugs and that it expects to issue them within
                        six months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Charging networks and charger manufacturers are also
                        responding. EVgo said in June that it will start
                        deploying NACS connectors on the high-speed chargers in
                        its U.S. network later this year. ABB, a Swiss maker of
                        industrial equipment including commercial EV chargers,
                        said on June 9 that it will offer NACS plugs as an
                        option on its chargers as soon as testing and validation
                        of the new connector is complete, likely in a few
                        months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And ChargePoint, which installs and manages chargers for
                        other businesses, said its clients can now order new
                        chargers with NACS connectors and that it can retrofit
                        its existing chargers with the Tesla-designed connectors
                        as well.

                    <p>
                        Tesla’s decision to open its network to other automakers
                        — and the companies’ willingness to accept the
                        invitation — will give drivers of non-Tesla EVs a lot
                        more options for charging on the go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But most experts agree that the U.S. will need many more
                        fast charging stations as the EV transition continues to
                        unfold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A provision in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed
                        in 2021, provides $5 billion in subsidies to states for
                        EV charging stations and related infrastructure between
                        2022 and 2026. The stated goal is to accelerate the
                        installation of 500,000 new EV chargers across the U.S.
                        by 2030, with at least one station every 50 miles along
                        major highways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The states in turn have been handing that funding out to
                        companies that are building charging stations — with a
                        few catches:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Companies are to build chargers that are convenient,
                            affordable and accessible to the broadest number of
                            people.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The states must ensure that some charging stations
                            are built in less dense areas, like rural regions
                            and tribal lands.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Charging companies must provide customers with
                            real-time updates as to whether the station is
                            occupied or out of service.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            There must be at least four 150-kilowatt CCS
                            fast-charging ports per station.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Charging operators can’t require drivers to sign up
                            for memberships to access chargers.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Chargers must have ports that can be used by “the
                            broadest number of vehicle owners.” Specifically,
                            proprietary charging stations that can only be
                            accessed by one company’s vehicles will not qualify
                            for funding.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        That last provision goes a long way to explaining why
                        Tesla decided to open up its charging network to other
                        automakers in a big step forward for EVs of all kinds.

                    <p>
                        And while the UAW is currently concerned about the
                        industry’s plans to transition to EVs — not least
                        because EVs have fewer parts and require fewer workers
                        to build than do internal-combustion vehicles —it’s
                        likely that those concerns will be addressed. It’s a
                        safe bet that EV adoption will accelerate over the next
                        few years as dozens of new EV models hit U.S.
                        dealerships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But while many more EVs are on the way, the charging
                        infrastructure buildout is still in its early stages. It
                        will be several more years until fast chargers are
                        available and convenient everywhere in the country.
