    <h1>Access to significant infrustructure</h1>
    <h2>Improvement does not appear to be across the board.</h2>
    <h3>By Einav Tsach</h3>
    <p>Electricity revolutionized the state of the world's economies, giving rise to the age of urban sprawl and mass factories. It accelerated the development of new technology, dependant on electricity.
    One such example is the internet, for which access depends on having a reliable connection to the electric grid. Data shows that despite significant inroads in
    increasing the access of lower-income countries to the electric grid (a nearly 30 percentage point increase across two decades), concerning gaps remain in the rates of internet use between different areas of the world. More developed areas,
    like Europe and North America, report high levels of internet use, while emerging economies like certain areas in Africa and Asia trail in their use of what has become a key element of the global economy. </p>
